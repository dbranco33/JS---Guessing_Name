# JavaScript - Guessing Game

## About the program

The computer will pick an integer value between 1 and 100, and the player will be prompted to make a guess.

The computer will alert the player about if his/her guess is correct or wrong:

-	If the guess is out of the range or not a number, the computer will tell that the entry was wrong.

- If the guess is higher/smaller than the correct value, the computer can say:

  - That the guess is 'too big' or 'too small'. 
  - That the guess is bigger/smaller but it's close ('Close!!!'). 
  
- If the guess is correct, the computer will congratulate the player and inform how much guesses he/she did to win the game.

The idea of this program/small project was to study and practice basic JavaScript techniques at Front-End/Client Side, the pages were created using responsive design and Bootstrap. The file with the javascript code is in .../assets/js/guessing_name.js
